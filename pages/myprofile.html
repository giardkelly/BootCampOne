	     <h1>About Myself</h1>
<br>

<p>I grew up in California. I had spent a lot of time at Santa Monica for the Beach and for the Doctors at UCLA. I lived in Tarzana and went to Reseda High. I then moved to Fresno around 1992. I have two children. I enjoy Music, Movies, Standup Comedy, and I also enjoy writing a poem when inspired. The greatest enjoyment is when a goal becomes a reality for you or for me, big or small.</p>
<br>
<p><h2>Jobs</h2></p>

<br><p>Mostly I worked in retail grocery stores, and Department stores. 
I have an extensive background in customer service, team management, problem solving and managerial duties. 
I also have a vast visual knowledge when reading and building schematics planograms. However I'm well versed in MS outlook, Microsoft word and excel. I also worked as an IT Technician. I had made forms and help build a website for Chiropractors using Omni form and Front page, XP professional was the latest greatest operating system. I had done the networking, administering, and port to port support as well train staff on the utilization of Active Care Conditioning Systems. Basically tasked to do a as much as I could with the knowledge of the world wide web. I began to thirst for the knowledge of technology and I always will.

	   <h3>A basic mind set.</h3>
	   <br>
	   <p>Visuals in your mind is key. I myself find a goal that I had already achieved for example: I 
	   visualize that I'm a huge success amoung great programmers. I visualize a plan I would like and I see myself
	   doing exactly that. I can't say my life has been exactly what I visualized, but I realize now that if I visualize 
	   fear and it runs through my mind something bad happens. When I visualize positive things, then I get good things
	   happening to me. 
	   I think anyone can see the power of this mental process. Visualization is all about achieving things. The interesting thing for us is that this technique works for anything that we want to do, visualizing yourself achieving success at whatever it is you want to achieve, dramatically improves your chances of achieving it. These benefits have been proven by many experiments.
	   You can visualize virtually anywhere but a quiet, safe place where you will not be disturbed is best. Simply focus your mind on what you want to do, keep replaying the internal film of yourself actually doing it. The amazing thing is that it has been proven that the benefit of visualizing the events is actually the same as if you had actually done it! I was very young when I learned this technique. I was very sick as child and spent many months even years if I add it all up.
	   So I learned to shut the world around me down, so I can see myself playing in the feilds with my sisters. I visualized myself 
	   growing up and not ill, obviouly it worked. I now have many moments to visualize success, self healing, and memory improvment to problem-solving and to decision-making. If you have problems visualizing a successful outcome, run through your internal picture again, step into the bodies of others observing you, what do they see, what do they think. Visualization can not only super-charge success it can also give you insight into potential issues. Many of these can simply be overcome by repainting your inner picture others may simply highlight a basic reality that may help you realign your immediate goals or expectations.</p>
